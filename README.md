# [Jobs](http://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/)

The goal here is to create a proper **"job board"** that pairs open source people and projects in need design work with designers who can do those tasks. It will be a mixture of *both gratis as well as paying work.* A job can be relatively small task to an entire project. I think the ideal balance would be a mixture of about:

* 25% small singular tasks
* 15% new or fork of an existing project
* 60% product / feature development on existing projects

*Note: this process is rough and a work in progress, please free to contribute ideas, approaches, and of course jobs :)*


### Submit a Job

Our job submission process is being done transparently and "in the open." If you work on an open source software project or community, feel free to submit a job to our job board by doing the following:

- Fork the repo
- Copy `job-template.md` into the `jobs` folder
- Name your compy something like `2015-03-sticker-design-for-lnug.md`
- Fill out the fields inside the template you just copied
- Keep one sentence per line (to make git diff cleaner)
- Submit a pull request
- Have a margarita or hot chocolate

After those steps you will have submitted a job to the OSD job board ;)

## Open Source Design "Meta" Tasks:

Anything related to improving O.S.D. directly. Listed in order of attainability.

#### • Identity & Logo
OSD  needs to craft an identity that is of the community and responds to the idea of open source in a clear, memorable way. Maybe that means the logo is something that is continuously iterated on, maybe it is something that has a consistent form that responds to changes in the greater community/world.

#### • Project listing page
What projects are currently in need of completion? The current solution has been to post each project as a github issue, which might be a good solution in the short term. It might be better to have an ongoing list where designers can post and up-vote freely.

#### • A space on the web
http://opensourcedesign.net redirects to Github. Would it meaningfully help the community to make a site with digests of all the repos?
